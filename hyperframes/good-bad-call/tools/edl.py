"""Edit decision list for the "Good call / Bad call" reel, from the uploaded timeline
(raw/good_bad_call.mp4, 143.5 s, assembled in Premiere by the user).

The upload is one talking-head take with hard cuts at 20.9, 38.8, 56.6, 90.0, 107.2 and 121.5 s; after almost every
cut there is 0.7-1.5 s of dead air before the next sentence (the "pauses" to remove).

No retakes to drop. Inside the timeline, pauses longer than 0.38 s are shortened, keeping 0.20 s after a word
ends and 0.12 s before the next one starts (silence map at -36 dB, d 0.12 s), so the hard cuts flow straight on.
